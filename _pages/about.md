I am a Donald R. Beall Defense Fellow in the Department of Defense Analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). 

My current research examines variation in patterns of political violence for state and non-state actors and illuminates how different strategies and institutions can best quell violence and promote peace. This work is part of a larger substantive research agenda that explores how intrastate and interstate conflicts evolve, how the allocation of resources and adoption of different countermeasures and institutions can establish political order, and how global competition over contested areas exacerbates violence.

I have extensive experience in conflict zones with over a decade serving in the special operations and intelligence communities, where I providing intelligence support to counterterrorism, counter WMD proliferation, and hostage rescue operations.

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Political Science at the University of Michigan. I also hold degrees from the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California San Diego (M.I.A.), the National Intelligence University (M.S.S.I), American Military University (B.A.), and Indiana University (B.A).

My research has been published in (or is forthcoming) in the International Journal of Cyber Warfare & Terrorism.
