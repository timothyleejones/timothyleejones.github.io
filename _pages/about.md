I am a Donald R. Beall Defense Fellow in the Department of Defense Analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). 

In my current research, I delve into the intricate dynamics that underlie the varying patterns of violence exhibited by state and non-state actors within intrastate conflicts. This effort is part of a larger research agenda, which helps unravel the complex evolution of armed conflicts, terrorism, and rebellion. Through this research, I aim to enhance our comprehension of how the allocation of resources and the implementation of different countermeasures can effectively establish and sustain political order, while also shedding light on how global competition over contested areas exacerbates violence.

My work is motivated and informed by over a decade of military and government service, largely operating in conflict zones. I had the privilege of serving within the Special Operations and Intelligence Communities, where I provided critical intelligence support across a spectrum of operations and to senior policymakers. These missions encompassed counterterrorism efforts, the prevention of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) proliferation, and hostage rescue operations across the globe.

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Political Science at the University of Michigan. I also hold degrees from the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California San Diego (M.I.A.), the National Intelligence University (M.S.S.I), American Military University (B.A.), and Indiana University (B.A).

This amalgamation of rigorous academic training and experience as a practitioner in national security forms the cornerstone of my commitment to research and instruction that enhances our collective understanding of international relations, security studies, conflict dynamics and promotes the pursuit of more effective strategies for maintaining peace and stability in an increasingly complex world.

My research has been published in (or is forthcoming) in the International Journal of Cyber Warfare & Terrorism.
