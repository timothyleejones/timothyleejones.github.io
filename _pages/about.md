![Consequences of War - Rubens](/images/los-horrores-de-la-guerra.png)

I am an America in the World Consortium Postdoctoral Fellow at Duke University’s Program in American Grand Strategy. Prior to this, I was a Faculty Associate for Research and a Donald R. Beall Defense Fellow in the Department of Defense Analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.

My research seeks to bridge academic inquiry and operational experience to generate scholarship that informs U.S. foreign policy and addresses real-world national security challenges. I focus on how intelligence, wartime aid, and violence is used by both state and non-state actors in civil conflict and strategic competition. This work contributes to a broader understanding of how political order is built and challenged, and factors that shape conflict dynamics.

One major line of research explores the evolving role of Special Operations Forces (SOF) in an era of strategic competition. I analyze how SOF can best deter adversaries, counter asymmetric threats, and operate in complex, contested environments. A key project within this effort examines Irregular Warfare in the Maritime domain (IW-M), assessing how SOF can build partner capacity, secure access in littoral regions, and disrupt hostile operations.

A second stream investigates how intelligence supports special operations during peacetime competition and crises. Drawing on my background in the Intelligence Community and Special Operations, I study the integration of intelligence in SOF decision-making, especially within interagency and multinational frameworks. At the Naval Postgraduate School, I designed and taught a graduate seminar on this topic to mid-career military officers, emphasizing practical application and emerging challenges.

A third research area focuses on the intersection of international aid, counterinsurgency, and peacebuilding. I explore how the sequencing and coordination of aid efforts—particularly when supporting fragile states—can influence the trajectory of conflict and the durability of peace. I advocate for context-specific strategies that align aid and security goals to avoid unintentionally fueling instability.

Before entering academia, I spent over a decade in the U.S. national security community, including service in the Army and as a senior intelligence officer with the Department of Defense and Department of the Navy. My assignments spanned Iraq, Afghanistan, East Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and Central Asia, where I supported special mission units and interagency teams conducting counterterrorism, counterproliferation, and hostage rescue operations.

I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Michigan. I also hold an M.I.A. from the University of California San Diego, an M.S. in Strategic Intelligence from the National Intelligence University, and B.A. degrees from American Military University and Indiana University.

My recent work appears in the International Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, the Minnesota Journal of International Law, and The Hill.
