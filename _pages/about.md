I am a Donald R. Beall Defense Fellow in the Department of Defense Analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). 

My current research explains variation in patterns of violence for state and non-state actors in intrastate conflicts. This work is part of a larger substantive research agenda that explores how armed conflicts evolve, how the allocation of resources and adoption of different countermeasures can best establish political order, and how global competition over contested areas exacerbates violence.

This work is motivated and informed from extensive experience in conflict zones, having spent over a decade serving in the special operations and intelligence communities providing intelligence support to counterterrorism, counter weapons of mass destruction (WMD) proliferation, and hostage rescue operations across the globe.

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Political Science at the University of Michigan. I also hold degrees from the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California San Diego (M.I.A.), the National Intelligence University (M.S.S.I), American Military University (B.A.), and Indiana University (B.A).

My research has been published in (or is forthcoming) in the International Journal of Cyber Warfare & Terrorism.
