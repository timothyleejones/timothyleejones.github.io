I have extensive experience teaching at the graduate and undergraduate levels, both in substantive topics and in research methods for the social sciences. At the University of Michigan, I designed courses at the graduate level for social science computing and I served as a Graduate Student Instructor for full-term classes in international relations and comparative politics in the Department of Political Science. During government and military service, I conducted instruction in analytic writing and tradecraft, and applied geospatial information services.
