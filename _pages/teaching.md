I have experience teaching and designing courses at the graduate and undergraduate levels, both in substantive topics and in research methods for the social sciences. At the Naval Postgraduate School, I have designed and taught graduate seminars for military and interagency professionals that develop critical thinking skills and specialized knowledge to navigate complex international security issues. These include courses on forecasting, analytic models, and intelligence communication, as well as a seminar on intelligence support to special operations that explores how interagency and multinational intelligence enables mission planning and execution in contested environments. At the University of Michigan, I designed graduate-level courses in data analysis and social science computing, and served as a Graduate Student Instructor for full-term undergraduate classes in international relations and comparative politics. During my government and military tenure, I regularly conducted instruction in analytic writing, intelligence tradecraft, and applied geospatial information services.
